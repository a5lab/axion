HTTP port and context path can be easily configured in *Axion*.

== HTTP Port
The default value for the HTTP port used to access the *Axion* user interface and resources is 8080. Therefore the user interface would be available at _http://localhost:8080/_. To change or update the port, locate the line  _port: 8080_ in _src/main/application.yml_ , then edit the number. For example, lets set the port value to _8081_:
....
port: 8081
....
The URL will be _http://localhost:8081/_.

== Changing the Context Path
To change or update the context path in the instance you want point to a specific webapp or component, locate the _context-path: /_ line in the _src/main/application.yml_. Example for directory named _axion_:
....
context-path: /axion/
....
The URL will be _http://localhost:8081/axion/_.
