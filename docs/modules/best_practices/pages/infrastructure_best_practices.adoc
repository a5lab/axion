Some advise on how to maintain your app.

== Application Maintenance

=== Regularly backup your database and components

* Create internal documentation on backup and failover action plans
* Testing your backup and recovery process at least once a year; quarterly is highly recommended

=== Stay up-to-date on upgrading *axion*

* Find the latest version on the download and compatibility and read the release notes
* Plan to upgrade your deployment at least once a quarter
* The product team typically releases once a month or sooner for critical patch releases
* Avoid upgrading production immediately after a new release
* Test upgrades in a test environment before deploying to production
* Backup your database and installation before upgrading

=== Configure *axion* to run as a service on the production server

* Create a service user to start and run the application, avoid using the root user

=== Configure your server behind a reverse proxy or a load balancer

* Offload configuration and workload for SSL termination
