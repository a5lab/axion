== Monitoring

Some advise on how to keep your work alive.

=== Use external tools to monitor the *tabr* health 

* Monitoring and reporting are expensive operations that can negatively affect your repository
* Offload reporting to external tools to minimize the impact on production servers
* Use these endpoints for the real-time status of the server
* Consider using the xref:https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] endpoint as a data source for other tools like Grafana or Elastic

==== Keep the audit log enabled

* The audit log is to track configuration changes
* This log is useful when troubleshooting/investigating issues

=== Use a test environment for running reports
* Use a recent backup to avoid putting strain on your production environment

=== Mine the log files 

* Learn about the logging options
* Use the nexus and request logs to track activity
* Details about each log file
